        <h3>Admin Team</h3>
        <p>This is David’s second HackBI, and this year he’s part of the Admin team. His favorite color is blue (baby blue, to be specific) and he helped make the workshop section of the website. David is also proud to admit he likes pineapple on pizza “(don’t judge me)”… you can debate what pizza toppings are valid if you stop by his App Inventor workshop!</p>

        <h3>Logistics Team Leader</h3>
        <p>When Jack isn’t coding away, you can usually find him fishing at his secret spot, climbing a mountain, or cooking a meal over a fire. This might lead you to believe he’s a true outdoorsman, but really he just needs privacy so he can plan his coup on Critter’s regime.</p>

Here, you can see Kieran in one of his many disguises. Have any questions about HackBI IV’s very own Clark Kent? Make sure you stop by the Minecraft Command Blocks workshop!</p>

        <p>Joe Lis has a knack for being in the right spot at the right time (several broken limbs not withstanding). I mean, just look at that gorgeous sunset! If you need to find a friendly face at Hack BI IV, just look for Joe. He hates being known as the tall, skinny kid, but if you see a tall, skinny kid, there’s a good chance that’s him.</p>

She also really likes Ethiopian food and Colombia (as a whole). She is biological twins with Wilson from Castaway (identical obv) and her two goals in life are to speak a language from every continent (she had three down so far) and try a dish from every country. Talk to Laura Segura about every Netflix series she’s watched at the Snap Workshop! Did I mention she likes Colombia? According to Laura: “I’m the Hispanic version of Sam lee.”</p>

Have you ever wondered what would happen if you let a bunch of crickets loose on a skyscraper? Well don’t ask Dagny because she’s terrified of both crickets and heights. To end on a better note, (haha see what I did there) Dagny is 100% confident in the fact that Disney really is the happiest place on Earth.</p>

(📸 creds to an undisclosed source). When he’s not using Photoshop, you can find Caleb on that Rocket League and Minecraft grind. He’s also one of Ireton’s Finest™ BIBVS goalies—you can’t miss him on the field. Like. Literally. The highlighter yellow and pink kits with matching bright orange cleats will forever be iconic.

(Dark mode FTW). If you were in her AP Lang class you’d know how much she loves Minecraft—and Photoshop! Mrs. Briody’s Image Editing class? 10/10 would recommend. She also thinks it’s kind of weird to write about herself in third person so I’m just gonna stop here. Hope everyone liked their bios!</p>
